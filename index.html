            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img class="profile-img" src="./assets/images/imageProfile.jpg" />        
        
            <p>I graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in Computer Science. I started my career as a Back-end Engineer, but about 10 years ago I decided to pursue my interest in Product Support simply because I enjoy interacting with people and with customers.</p> 
            <p>The reason I am taking this bootcamp is because I find it difficult to get back in to software developer world now. My knowledges are not only rusty, but there are so many new and powerful applications available out there that I am not aware of. So, taking this bootcamp is a great thing for me to get me back in track.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy volunteering at local schools, and non profit organization. The best non profit organization that I have been with is the Habitat for Humanity, where I got to help building housing frames from individual wood stalks. I also have the obsession to germinate, grow and raise exotic fruit plants. So far I have been sucessfully germinating Hawaiian papaya, mexican mangoes, Asian chilli peppers, and more, however, I have not been able to keep them alive beyond 3 inches height.</p>
